The "Product recommendation" project appears to focus on building a recommendation system. Hereâ€™s a summary based on the key sections found in the notebook:

Project Description
Purpose:

This project aims to create a product recommendation system that suggests relevant products to users based on user interactions and product popularity.
Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is filtered to include only users who have given at least 50 ratings, reducing sparsity and making it easier to work with.
Density Calculation: Analyzes the density of ratings, which helps in understanding the distribution and interaction intensity.
Methods Used:

Rank-Based Recommendation: Ranks products by average rating and minimum interactions, allowing for popularity-based recommendations.
Similarity-Based Recommendation: Implements a user cosine similarity function to identify and recommend products that similar users have rated highly.
Technologies Used:

Python with typical data science libraries (possibly including Pandas, NumPy, and possibly a library for cosine similarity).
Usage:

The model can recommend the top 5 products with a certain minimum number of interactions, making it suitable for e-commerce or similar platforms where user-product interactions are recorded.
